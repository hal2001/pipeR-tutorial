# pipeR Tutorial
#### by Kun Ren

[pipeR](http://renkun.me/pipeR) is an R package that helps you better organize your code in pipeline built with `%>>%`, `Pipe()` or `pipeline()`, which is much easier to read, write, and maintain.

The package defines a set of syntax tailored for unified, intuitive piping experience. This allows you to write code like a streamline that is consistent with your logic and intuition.

This tutorial serves as a complete guide to using pipeR functionality to make your code concise yet highly readable and less of ambiguity.
