#### by Kun Ren

[pipeR](http://renkun.me/pipeR) provides Pipe operator and function based on syntax which support to pipe value to first-argument of a function, to dot in expression, by formula as lambda expression, for side-effect, and with assignment. The set of syntax is designed to make the pipeline highly readable.
