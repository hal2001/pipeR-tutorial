# pipeR Tutorial
#### by Kun Ren

[pipeR](http://renkun.me/pipeR) is an R package that helps you better organize your code in pipeline, which is much easier to read, write, and maintain.

This package provides an operator that is able to evaluate a function or expression on the right-hand side with the value on the left-hand side being the first unnamed argument, and/or a representative symbol `.`, or any user-defined symbol. 

Basically, the expression is evaluated according to a set of syntax tailored for unified, intuitive piping experience. This allows you to write code like a streamline that is consistent with your logic and intuition.

This tutorial is a complete guide to using pipeR functionality to make your code concise yet highly readable and less of ambiguity.
