# Examples

In this chapter, we will show some examples to demonstrate how pipeR features are useful when it works with other packages. We single out the following packages that are by design pipe-friendly and how to they unleash tremendous productivity from you working with pipeR.

* [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr): manipulate tabular data
* [rlist](http://renkun.me/rlist/): work with non-tabular data in lists
* [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest): make web-scraping easy and flexible

Throughout these examples, we will explain the dataset first, use pipeline operations to explore the data, and answer some interesting questions. We will also suggest some good practice that may be help write code that is easy to read, write, and maintain using pipeR.
