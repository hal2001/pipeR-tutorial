# Pipeline

This chapter demonstrates features introduced by `pipeline()`. This function builds and evaluates argument-based or expression-based pipeline. What makes it special is that it does not require using pipe operator `%>>%`, nor does it create a `Pipe` object as a wrapper. Using `pipeline()`, you will be able to write cleaner pipeline expressions with less noise.
