Before getting started, please ensure you have installed the latest version of pipeR.

This tutorial will introduce all features of the package in detail. It not only applies to the latest stable release, but also covers most new features in the latest development version. The description of a feature will show the version of the package it assumes.

You can install the latest stable release (v0.4-2) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pipeR):
