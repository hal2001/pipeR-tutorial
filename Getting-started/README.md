# Getting started

Before getting started, please ensure you have installed the latest version of pipeR.

This tutorial will introduce all features of the package in detail. It not only applies to the latest stable release, but also covers most new features in the latest development version. The description of a feature will show the version of the package it assumes.

You can install the latest version of pipeR from [GitHub](https://github.com/renkun-ken/pipeR) with `devtools`:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("renkun-ken/pipeR")
```

or a older version from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pipeR):

```r
install.packages("pipeR")
```

I recommend that you install the GitHub version to keep up with the latest features which are also covered in the code examples in this tutorial.
