```{r knitsetup, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
opts_knit$set(base.dir='./', fig.path='', out.format='md')
opts_chunk$set(prompt=FALSE, comment='', fig.align = 'center', results='markup')
```

# Extract element

`x %>>% (y)` means extracting the element named `y` from object `x` where `y` must be a valid symbol name and `x` can be a vector, list, environment or anything else for which `[[]]` is defined, or S4 object.

```r
mtcars %>>%
  (lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = .)) %>>%
  (~ lm_mtcars) %>>%
  summary %>>%
  (r.squared)
```

To evaluate an expression within the piped object if it is a list or environment, use `with()` can be helpful.

```r
list(a = 1, b = 2) %>>%
  with(a+2*b)
```

But this method does not work for vector and S4 object.
